# CasTor :beaver:

Tor HTTP proxy with balanced Tor instances.

![Tor balance schema](docs/tor-balance.png)

## Requirements

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Usage

### Quickstart

This command will start one Tor instance and HAProxy:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

The HTTP proxy will be running on port **8080**.

### Start multiple Tor instances

Use the docker-compose scale option to set the number of Tor instance to start

For instance to start 5 Tor instances:

```bash
docker-compose up --scale tor=5
```

### Run proxy on a different port

Proxy port can be set using the environement varaible `HTTP_PROXY_PORT`. You can specify it in the [`.env`](.env) file or dirrectly in the shell such as:

```bash
export HTTP_PROXY_PORT=8080
```

## Test the proxy

Once the application is started, you can test your proxy with `curl`:

```bash
# test without the proxy
$ curl https://ipinfo.io/ip
A.B.C.D     # => your current IP address

# test with the proxy
$ curl -x http://localhost:8080 https://ipinfo.io/ip
W.X.Y.Z     # => Tor exit node IP address
``` 

## How is it working ?

When you run the command `docker-compose up`, you start at least 3 services (more if you scaled up the number of Tor instances): **tor**, **conf-generator** and **haproxy**.

The first service started is **tor**, this service is running a Tor instance with a Tor HTTP Tunnel (mandatory to have an HTTP proxy rather than a sock proxy).

The second service is **conf-generator**, this services runs a python script that does the following things:

1. get all the IP address of the Tor instances within the docker network (using the Docker API)
2. generate an HAProxy configuration file with the retrieved IPs

The final service is an HAProxy load balancer using the configuration file generated by **conf-generator**.
